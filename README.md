# Giphy
This exercise is about calling the GIPHY API to populate gifs of the users choice. This also requires Javascript and jQuery to change the format of the site.

## Getting Started

There are some pre-selected comedies to choose from. Click on a button and it'll populate 10 still gifs. To animate a single gif, click on it. To stop the animation, click it again.

If you'd like to populate a list of other comedies not listed in the pre-selected section, simply use the search bar. After your button is created, click on the button to view the gifs. 

Each gif will also have a rating available.
